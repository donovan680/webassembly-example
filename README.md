# webassembly-example
WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. 

Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust,

enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

The web platform is getting a new low-level binary compile format that will do a better job at being 

a compiler target than JavaScript.
